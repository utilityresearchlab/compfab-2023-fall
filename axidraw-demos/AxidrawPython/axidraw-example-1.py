interactive_xy.py

Demonstrate use of axidraw module in "interactive" mode.

Run this demo by calling: python interactive_xy.py


---------------------------------------------------------------------

About the interactive API:

Interactive mode is a mode of use, designed for plotting individual motion
segments upon request, using direct XY control. It is a complement to the
usual plotting modes, which take an SVG document as input.

So long as the AxiDraw is started in the home corner, moves are limit checked,
and constrained to be within the safe travel range of the AxiDraw.

if not connected:
    sys.exit() # end script

# Draw square, using "moveto/lineto" (absolute move) syntax:

ad.moveto(1, 1)              # Absolute pen-up move, to (1 inch, 1 inch)
ad.lineto(2, 1)              # Absolute pen-down move, to (2 inches, 1 inch)

ad.moveto(0, 0)              # Absolute pen-up move, back to origin.

ad.delay(2000)              # Delay 2 seconds

# Change some options:
ad.options.units = 1              # set working units to cm.
ad.options.speed_pendown = 10     # set pen-down speed to slow
ad.options.pen_pos_up = 90        # select a large range for the pen up/down swing
ad.options.pen_pos_down = 10

ad.update()                 # Process changes to options

# Draw an "X" through the square, using "move/line" (relative move) syntax:
# Note that we have just changed the units to be in cm.

ad.move(5.08, 5.08)          # Relative move to (2 inches,2 inches), in cm
ad.line(-2.54, -2.54)        # Relative move 2.54 cm in X and Y
ad.move(0, 2.54)
ad.line(2.54, -2.54)         # Relative move 2.54 cm in X and Y

ad.moveto(0, 0)              # Return home


# Change some options, just to show how we do so:
ad.options.units = 0        # set working units back to inches.
ad.options.speed_pendown = 75     # set pen-down speed to fast
ad.options.pen_rate_lower = 10 # Set pen down very slowly
ad.update()                 # Process changes to options


# Draw a "+" through the square, using "go/goto" commands,
# which do not automatically set the pen up or down:

ad.goto(1.5, 1.0)
ad.pendown()
ad.go(0,1)
ad.penup()
ad.goto(1.0, 1.5)
ad.pendown()
ad.go(1,0)
ad.penup()

ad.goto(0, 0)                # Return home
